## Overview
Welcome to the Employee Churn Prediction Project! This project aims to provide valuable insights and predictive models for organizations looking to address employee turnover. Employee churn can have a significant impact on productivity and overall company success. By leveraging exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, various data visualizations, and machine learning techniques, this project helps organizations make data-driven decisions to reduce employee turnover and improve retention strategies.

## Key Features
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): This project starts with a comprehensive exploration of the employee dataset. We dive deep into the data to understand its characteristics, uncover trends, and identify potential factors contributing to employee churn.

* Data Cleaning: High-quality data is essential for accurate predictions. We performed thorough data cleaning, handling missing values, outliers, and ensured data integrity.

* Data Visualizations: Visualizing data is crucial for gaining insights. We utilised a variety of data visualization techniques, such as histograms, scatter plots, and heat maps, to reveal patterns and relationships within the data.

* Machine Learning Models: Two powerful machine learning models are developed - a Decision Tree and a Random Forest. These models are trained on the cleaned and visualized data to predict employee churn. The project boasts impressive final evaluation scores, with roc_auc metric exceeding 95%.
