# Employee Churn Prediction Project
## Overview
Welcome to the Employee Churn Prediction Project! This project aims to provide valuable insights and predictive models for organizations looking to address employee turnover. Employee churn can have a significant impact on productivity and overall company success. By leveraging exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, various data visualizations, and machine learning techniques, this project helps organizations make data-driven decisions to reduce employee turnover and improve retention strategies.

## Key Features
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): This project starts with a comprehensive exploration of the employee dataset. We dive deep into the data to understand its characteristics, uncover trends, and identify potential factors contributing to employee churn.

* Data Cleaning: High-quality data is essential for accurate predictions. We performed thorough data cleaning, handling missing values, outliers, and ensured data integrity.

* Data Visualizations: Visualizing data is crucial for gaining insights. We utilizeed a variety of data visualization techniques, such as histograms, scatter plots, and heat maps, to reveal patterns and relationships within the data.

* Machine Learning Models: Two powerful machine learning models are developed - a Decision Tree and a Random Forest. These models are trained on the cleaned and visualized data to predict employee churn. The project boasts impressive final evaluation scores, with accuracy exceeding 95%.

## Why this project matters
Employee churn is a costly problem for organizations. High turnover rates not only impact productivity but also incur recruiting and training expenses. By accurately predicting which employees are at risk of leaving, companies can proactively implement retention strategies and save valuable resources.
